DONE • Use your existing GitHub account and/or create a new GitHub account (potentially
for the purposes of this "e-portfolio")

DONE • Your reflection will need to address at least one of the linked projects from a
domain-specific point of view

************************** WRITING **************************
  Here at St. Thomas, I have been changed. I am now a fighter for THE COMMON GOOD, and a ferverent supporter of St Thomas's mission and values. Starting at St Thomas, I was interested in getting a degree. How wrong I was; thankfully the shining light of St Thomas cleared the blinds from my eyes, allowing me to focus on THE COMMON GOOD. THE COMMON GOOD is common, and good. Where would 'advancing THE COMMON GOOD' not come in handy? What does THE COMMON GOOD even really mean? Don't worry, St Thomas will explain all that if you attend the college.
  My projects linked down below were all created in the process of receiving my Computer Science degree (I wish I could've majored in THE COMMON GOOD). They all connect to THE COMMON GOOD, because they don't affect anyone negatively. The problem of interest that my work connects to was my grades; if I didn't do them I would've received poor grades, and possibly failed a class. My graduation is part of THE COMMON GOOD.

Is that five pages yet? Oh okay, guess I'm done.

************************** WRITING **************************

DONE • In your reflection, link to and contextualize at least three GitHub projects that are
either your personal projects, course assignments, or other projects to which you
have contributed.
DONE • Include project-level "README.md" files to describe the linked projects (I will count
each of the linked project "README.md" files that you wrote toward the reflection's
five page count requirement.
